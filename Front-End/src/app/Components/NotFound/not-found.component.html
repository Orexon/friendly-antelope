      "I met a traveller from an antique land,<br />
      Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
      Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br />
      Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
      And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
      Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
      Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
      The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
      And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />
      My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br />
      Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />
      Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
      Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br />
      The lone and level sands stretch far away.” <br />
      <br />
      "Ozymandias" - by Percy Bysshe Shelley. <br />
